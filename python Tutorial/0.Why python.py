### Why Python? :

# The python language is one of the most accessible
#  programming languages available because it has simplified syntax
#  and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language.
#  Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily
#  written and executed much faster than other programming languages

#### Python Syntax:

# Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
# Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities
# to the English language with influence from mathematics.
# Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed  
# to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
# Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops,
# functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
