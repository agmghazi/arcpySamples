# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Operator	Name	           Example
# +	       Addition	           x + y	
# -	       Subtraction	       x - y	
# *	       Multiplication      x * y	
# /	       Division	           x / y	
# %	       Modulus	           x % y	
# **	   Exponentiation      x ** y	
# //	   Floor division      x // y

# Python Assignment Operators
# Operator	   Example	    Same As	
# =	           x = 5	    x = 5	
# +=       	   x += 3	    x = x + 3	
# -=	       x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
# *=	       x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
# /=	       x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
# %=	       x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
# //=	       x //= 3	    x = x // 3	
# **=	       x **= 3	    x = x ** 3	
# &=	       x &= 3	    x = x & 3	
# |=	       x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
# ^=	       x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	       x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
# <<=	       x <<= 3	    x = x << 3

# Python Comparison Operators
# Operator	Name	                    Example	
# ==	    Equal	                    x == y	
# !=	    Not equal	                x != y	
# >     	Greater than	            x > y	
# <	        Less than	                x < y	
# >=    	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=    	Less than or equal to	    x <= y


# Python Logical Operators
# Operator	Description	                                                     Example	
# and 	    Returns True if both statements are true	                     x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	    Returns True if one of the statements is true	                 x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	    Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	         not(x < 5 and x < 10)

# Python Identity Operators
# Operator	Description                                         	Example	
# is 	    Returns True if both variables are the same object	    x is y	
# is not    Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y	

# Python Membership Operators
# Operator	Description                                                                      	Example	
# in 	    Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object     	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y	

# Python Bitwise Operators
# Operator	Name	                 Description
# & 	    AND	                     Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# |      	OR	                     Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
#  ^     	XOR	                     Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ 	    NOT	                     Inverts all the bits
# <<    	Zero fill left shift	 Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >>	    Signed right shift	     Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
